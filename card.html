			<p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae in the order 
			Proboscidea. Three species are currently recognised: the African bush 
			elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), 
			and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Elephants are scattered 
			throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. 
			Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, 
			now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mastodons, 
			anancids and stegodontids; Elephantidae itself also contains several now extinct 
			groups, such as the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants</p>
